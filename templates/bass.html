  Hofner 500/1 Violin Bass
  </h2>
  <br>
  <h3 style="color:black">This Bass guitar was designed by Walter Hofner in
  1955. His intention was to produce a bass guitar that would be appealing to
  players of the bass (double bass) who no longer wanted to carry such a big
  heavy instrument. The Hofner 500/1 is also the bass guitar Paul McCartney
  used to play with the Beatles.

  Fender Jazz Bass

  <h3 style="color:black">The Jazz Bass was introduced in 1960 as an
  alternative to the Precision Bass. Though it was a sibling of the Precision
  Bass it had many key diffrences. The result was a rich brighter tone with
  more pronounced mid and upper frequencies.
